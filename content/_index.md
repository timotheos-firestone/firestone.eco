My name is **Timotheos**. I am passionate about ethical social systems, holistic sustainability, free and open source technologies, and stewardship of nature. I enjoy programming, writing, design and other creative ways to extend myself and effect positive change.

I currently work as a video games developer with a for-profit company, which I'm hoping to transition away from soon. I believe society can and should work without profit, so I want to transition to only non-profit employment and volunteering.

My main project is [Firestone Sanctuary](http://sanctuary.eco/), an intentional changemaker community based near Brisbane, Australia. Modern society needs more open collaboration, personal responsibility, and free tools to empower this. The Sanctuary is a launchpad for these ideas and many sub-projects.
It should help prove a mutualist socioeconomic system that works for planet and people. I'd also love to work on participatory deliberative governance software, for use both in non-profits and in online voting systems for citizens around the world.

My interests and projects include:

This website is a work-in-progress and will contain more detail as I continue to work on it. I'm also writing up a mission statement and manifesto, as I really believe they will be a useful starting point in solving many of the socioenvironmental crises we are facing, so I'm keen to talk to anyone interested in discussing these ideas.
